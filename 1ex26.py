   # first,I read the code starting with the first line,and I try to figure out what the code are used for.At the same time,I would keep an eye on the spling mistakes.Sometimes,there was no mistakes both in speling and grammer,I would chage the code to the code in ex24.py and ex25.py."
   #Second,I would run the code I have checked and refined,then found more mistakes that I missed through Pyhton and hacked them untli there is no mistakes.
