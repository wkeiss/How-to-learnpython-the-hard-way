I learn python2 through the awesome book [*learn python the hard way*](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).

This repository is used to save my code.

I use "ex" and "try" to distinguish the code for "excises" and the code for "study dirlls".

Thanks for Zed A. Shaw,your book is very very helpful for me .Thanks for bringing so much fun for me to learn Python.

Also,I need to thank @flyouting ,thank you very much for your gitbook [*learn python the hard way 中文版*](https://www.gitbook.com/book/flyouting/learn-python-the-hard-way-cn/details)
